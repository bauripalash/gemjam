# GemJam 
> A simple and fast gemlog builder (Prototype)

### Information
This gemjam program was made for writing and easily maintaining my personal gemlog at <gemini://gem.palashbauri.in>. I don't actually intend to make the feature rich because it does one thing best, which is help me maintain my gemlog with ease. If anybody intend to fork make the more useful, Please do.

Though, I have a few things on mind to put in this project, but I am little busy with these college stuffs.


### Contributing
This is just a prototype and does the job for now, but if you have any ideas or found any bugs, please create an issue or send a patch (It's called Pull Request in Github). 
This project is licensed under MIT license so, Fork it, hack it.
